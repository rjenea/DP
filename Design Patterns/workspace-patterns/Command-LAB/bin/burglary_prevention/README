Command Patterns makes it easier to reverse actions.

=> Add an undo() to the command interface.  Alter the Television to have 3 channels, store the last channel and allow the invoker to:

remoteControl.setCommand(0, televisionChannel3, curtainClose);

, then call undo() and reverse these actions.

See RemoteControl2, Television and Television command classes.
